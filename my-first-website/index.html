        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p> This website is about who I am and things I want to do!  </p>

        <p> Hi! My name is Tu Quynh Vuu, but I often go by TQ. 
            I was born in Saigon, Vietnam, but have lived in California, USA for most of my life! 
            I'm currently in Shanghai, China as a college freshman at NYU Shanghai!

        <h2>Saigon, Vietnam</h2>         
        <p>Saigon is located in the Southern area of Vietnam. 
            Although it is not the capital (Hanoi, Northern Vietnam), it is the largest city in the South. 
            Both my parents grew up in Vietnam, my mom in Saigon, and my dad in My Tho (the countryside). 
            My older sister and I were both born in Vietnam, but my family immigrated to the United States in 2006.
            Most of my relatives still live in Vietnam today.</p>
