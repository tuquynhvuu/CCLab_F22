      <h3>Particles</h3>
      <p>For this mini project, the main focus was on particles and manipulating their
        movements by coding in behaviors and methods. We were to use a class for the
        particles, and add in at least 3 features to add to its movement, and also to
        create effects. I wanted to depict a scene of snowfall in the winter. To achieve
        this, I coded the particles to appear from the top of the screen, and fall to
        the bottom, where they then reappear, making the motion nonstop. I also wanted
        the result to be interactive, so I added in the keyPressed feature so that once
        the key “q” is pressed, then clouds appear, and the particles start to shift
        right and move faster. I also wanted to create a visual effect where the snow
        piles at the bottom as each particle falls, but encountered some difficulties
        with the code. Due to this, I decided to make the appearance give off a facade
        effect, similar to a gif where each frame restarts. Object oriented programming
        is when the code is characterized by implementing classes of objects linking them
        with methods. A class is essentially a template for creating objects, making it
        more simple to replicate multiple versions of the same object. Object oriented
        programming is useful when you want to create the same objects, while modifying
        slight aspects of them; it simplifies the code and saves time. The object I made
        was snow, using class to define it as Particle. The properties I implemented into
        the particles include diameter, x speed, and y speed. The methods I used to fulfill
        my outcome include reappear, slowDown, keyPressed, and pile. Reappear makes it
        possible for the snow to constantly fall once it disappears from the bottom of the
        screen. Once the mouse is clicked on the canvas multiple times, slowDown makes it
        possible for the particles to slow down with every click. I used keyPressed to spawn
        clouds, while also making the particles shift right and move faster. Pile was used
        to create the visual effect of snow piling on the ground. This project was quite
        difficult for me to carry out my initial visual because it was confusing to make
        the particles have the exact visual effects I wanted. Overall, my project looks
        quite simple, but it was incredibly difficult to code it properly as I experimented
        with various trials and errors.
